This project consists of 4 tasks. 
1. Manual control of a car to move to certain points
2. Autonomous motion of the car to the same points.
3. Obstacle Avoidance.
4. Homing accuracy

## Code Organization

IR_mapping is used to map out the buttons on the infrared remote.

StepperTest is a program used to experiment with the motion of the robot.

Initial_code and StepperTest were created to test some basic functions and requirements.

Task_1, Task_2, Task_4 contain some early working code for the respective tasks. Task_3 was not completed on its own, and can be found entirely within CombinedTasks.

CombinedTasks is the final code and can perform all four tasks. It contains some calculations that determine the hardcoded paths.
